# On-Page SEO Fundamentals

On-page SEO refers to the optimization of individual web pages to rank higher in search engines and earn more relevant traffic. This involves optimizing both the content and HTML source code of a page, unlike off-page SEO which involves external signals.

## Core On-Page Elements

### 1. Title Tags (`<title>`)

The title tag is one of the most important on-page SEO factors, appearing as the clickable headline in search results.

**Best Practices:**
- Keep titles between 50-60 characters (512-569 pixels)
- Include primary keyword near the beginning
- Write compelling, descriptive titles that encourage clicks
- Avoid keyword stuffing
- Make each title unique across your site

**Example:**
```html
<!-- Good -->
<title>Complete Guide to On-Page SEO | 2024 Best Practices</title>

<!-- Poor -->
<title>SEO, On-Page SEO, Search Engine Optimization, SEO Guide</title>
```

**Performance Impact:** According to Backlinko's analysis of 11.8 million Google search results, pages with keywords in the title tag have a 45% higher click-through rate¹.

### 2. Meta Descriptions

While not a direct ranking factor, meta descriptions significantly impact click-through rates from search results.

**Best Practices:**
- Keep between 150-160 characters
- Include primary and secondary keywords naturally
- Write compelling, action-oriented descriptions
- Avoid duplicate meta descriptions
- Include a clear value proposition

**Example:**
```html
<meta name="description" content="Master on-page SEO with our comprehensive 2024 guide. Learn title optimization, header structure, and internal linking strategies that boost rankings.">
```

### 3. Header Structure (H1-H6)

Headers create content hierarchy and help search engines understand your content structure.

**Best Practices:**
- Use only one H1 per page (contains primary keyword)
- Create logical hierarchy: H1 → H2 → H3 → H4 → H5 → H6
- Include relevant keywords in headers naturally
- Keep headers descriptive and user-friendly

**Example Structure:**
```html
<h1>Complete Guide to On-Page SEO</h1>
  <h2>Core On-Page Elements</h2>
    <h3>Title Tags</h3>
    <h3>Meta Descriptions</h3>
  <h2>Advanced Optimization Techniques</h2>
    <h3>Schema Markup</h3>
    <h3>Internal Linking</h3>
```

### 4. URL Structure

Clean, descriptive URLs improve both user experience and search engine crawling.

**Best Practices:**
- Use lowercase letters only
- Separate words with hyphens (not underscores)
- Keep URLs concise and descriptive
- Include primary keyword when relevant
- Avoid special characters and parameters when possible

**Examples:**
```
✅ Good: /content-optimization/on-page-seo
❌ Poor: /page?id=123&cat=seo&type=guide
```

## Content Optimization

### Keyword Optimization

**Primary Keyword Placement:**
- Title tag (beginning)
- H1 header
- First 100 words of content
- Meta description
- URL slug
- At least one subheader (H2/H3)

**Keyword Density:** Maintain 1-2% keyword density. Focus on natural language rather than exact keyword repetition.

### Content Length and Quality

Research by SEMrush shows that longer content tends to perform better:
- **Top 10 results average 1,447 words**²
- **Pages with 1,500+ words get 68% more shares**³
- **Long-form content receives 77% more backlinks**⁴

**Quality Factors:**
- Comprehensive coverage of the topic
- Original insights and data
- Clear, scannable formatting
- Up-to-date information
- Proper grammar and spelling

### Internal Linking Strategy

Internal links help search engines understand site structure and distribute page authority.

**Best Practices:**
- Use descriptive anchor text
- Link to relevant, related content
- Maintain logical site hierarchy
- Include 2-5 internal links per 1,000 words
- Avoid excessive linking

**Example:**
```html
<!-- Good -->
<a href="/keyword-research/fundamentals">keyword research fundamentals</a>

<!-- Poor -->
<a href="/keyword-research/fundamentals">click here</a>
```

## Technical On-Page Elements

### Schema Markup

Structured data helps search engines understand your content context.

**Common Schema Types:**
- Article
- FAQ
- HowTo
- Product
- Organization
- BreadcrumbList

**Example Article Schema:**
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Article",
  "headline": "Complete Guide to On-Page SEO",
  "author": {
    "@type": "Person",
    "name": "Omar Corral"
  },
  "datePublished": "2024-01-15",
  "image": "https://example.com/on-page-seo-guide.jpg"
}
```

### Image Optimization

Images impact both user experience and page speed.

**Best Practices:**
- Use descriptive file names
- Add alt text for accessibility and SEO
- Compress images for faster loading
- Use appropriate file formats (WebP, AVIF for modern browsers)
- Include captions when relevant

**Example:**
```html
<img 
  src="on-page-seo-checklist.webp" 
  alt="Complete on-page SEO checklist with 15 optimization steps"
  width="800" 
  height="600"
>
```

## Performance Optimization

### Core Web Vitals

Google's Core Web Vitals are essential for on-page SEO success:

**Largest Contentful Paint (LCP):** Should occur within 2.5 seconds
**First Input Delay (FID):** Should be less than 100 milliseconds  
**Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS):** Should be less than 0.1

### Mobile Optimization

With Google's mobile-first indexing:
- Use responsive design
- Ensure touch targets are properly sized
- Optimize for thumb navigation
- Test across multiple devices
