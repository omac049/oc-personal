## Domain Included

**Your Domain:** `figshomecare.com`

This project includes domain registration and setup for your website address.

### What's Included vs. Not Included

| Included | Not Included |
|----------|--------------|
| Domain registration (figshomecare.com) | Web hosting fees |
| Domain setup and DNS configuration | Ongoing hosting costs |

**Note:** Web hosting is a separate ongoing cost (typically $10-30/month depending on provider). I'll recommend hosting options and can assist with setup, but hosting fees are paid directly to the hosting provider.

## Understanding Websites: A Quick Guide

*Since this may be your first website project, here's a helpful overview of how the pieces fit together:*

### The Three Parts of Every Website

Think of a website like a house:

**1. Domain Name (Your Address)**
- This is your website's address: `figshomecare.com`
- It's how people find you online (like a street address)
- Purchased annually (typically $12-20/year)
- **Included in this project** — I'll register and set up figshomecare.com for you

**2. Web Hosting (Your Land)**
- This is where your website files "live" on the internet
- A hosting company provides server space to store your site
- Paid monthly or annually (typically $10-30/month)
- **Not included** — This is a separate, ongoing cost you pay to a hosting provider
- I'll recommend reliable hosting options and help with setup

**3. Website (Your House)**
- This is the actual design, content, and functionality
- What visitors see and interact with
- Built once, then maintained as needed
- **This is what I'm building for you**

### How They Work Together

```
Visitor types figshomecare.com → Domain points to hosting → Hosting serves your website
```

### Common Questions

**Q: Why isn't hosting included?**
A: Hosting is an ongoing monthly/annual cost paid to a third-party provider. Including it would require you to pay me monthly forever. Instead, you'll have a direct relationship with your hosting provider and full control of your account.

**Q: What hosting do you recommend?**
A: For a business website like FIGS, I typically recommend:
- **SiteGround** (~$15-25/month) — Excellent support, reliable
- **Bluehost** (~$10-15/month) — Budget-friendly, good for starters
- **WP Engine** (~$25-35/month) — Premium, if using WordPress

**Q: What happens after the website is built?**
A: Once launched, your site is yours. You'll have:
- Login credentials to make basic updates
- Documentation on how to use your site
- Support period included (30 days to 3 months depending on package)
- Option for ongoing maintenance if desired

### Technical Features
- Mobile-responsive design (critical for healthcare searches)
- Fast loading times
- SSL certificate (HTTPS) for security
- SEO-optimized structure
- Contact form with email notifications
- Click-to-call phone numbers on mobile
